# Policies for Contributing
## Code of Conduct
We wish reinforce an environment conducive to development and cooperation. As such, a few rules are in order. These rules apply mainly here, but also if you choose to represent Gruppe-8-org in public.
### Standards
Examples of good behavior include:
* Inclusive and welcoming language
* Being respectful whilst receiving or sharing points of view - especially if they conflict with those of others
* Reporting security vulnerabilities (also publicly)
Examples of unacceptable behavior include
* Threats to physical safety, mockery, slander and unwanted attention.
* Doxing
* Pushes to main without pull requests
* Intentional introduction of security vulnerabilities in the code
### Our roles
We maintain the code, communicate and reinforce standards. We reserve the power to remove and edit commits, code, comments, issues and other contributions that violate the code of conduct.
### Scope
These rules apply mainly in this repository, but also if you represent Gruppe-8-org in public - both online and offline (if you are appointed as a representative for an IRL event). This includes nicknames and email addresses that refer to this organization. This does not mean that you can't create a social media profile or email to criticize the organization. However, representing the organization by choosing a nickname equal to, or very similar to, this organization's name, is within this scope.
### Enforcement
Instances of abuse may be reported to Gruppe-8-org@codemail.com. All such instances are reviewed and result in responses proportional to the violation. Your report will be confidential.
Contributors in violation of the code will be punished.
